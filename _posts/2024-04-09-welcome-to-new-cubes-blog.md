# Welcome to the Interactive Cubes Blog!

You've found the special red cube! This is your gateway to exploring our blog about Three.js, WebGL, and creative coding.

## About This Project

This blog combines interactive 3D visualizations with written content. The main page features thousands of floating cubes, with one special red cube that leads you here. This interaction demonstrates the power of Three.js for creating engaging web experiences.

## How It Works

The cube visualization you just interacted with uses several advanced Three.js features:

1. **GPU Picking** - To detect which cube you're hovering over
2. **Custom Shaders** - For efficient rendering of thousands of cubes
3. **TrackballControls** - For smooth camera movement
4. **Merged Geometries** - For optimal performance

## Stay Connected
